## Project Overview

This data analysis task is from take home assignment for a data science position 

After a series of box office flops, the producers at your studio are starting to question their strategy and need some
direction. You suggest a new approach - using data to determine what factors go into making a successful film. Luckily, 
you have a dataset of over 5000 films to mine for insights. Your producers ask you to spend some time analyzing the data 
and present a report detailing your findings, along with recommendations on how to revamp the studio’s strategy.
